### 🛠 Step 1: Build and Run the Product

```bash
make run
```

---

### 🔑 Step 2: Try Out the Product

#### 1️⃣ Try Out Client Credentials Flow

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50MTIzOnNlY3JldDEyMw==' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```

- **Client ID:** `client123`
- **Client Secret:** `secret123`

#### 2️⃣ Try Out Authorization Code Flow

- Open the following URL in your browser:

  ```bash
  https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client123&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
  ```

- Enter the following credentials:

  - **Username:** `thor`
  - **Password:** `thor123`

    **Note:** The credentials can be configured in the `repository/conf/deployment.yaml` file under the `user_store` section.

- After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

  ```bash

  https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
  ```

- Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

  ```bash
  curl -k --location 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50MTIzOnNlY3JldDEyMw==' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
  --data-urlencode 'code=<code>'
  ```

  - **Client ID:** `client123`
  - **Client Secret:** `secret123`
